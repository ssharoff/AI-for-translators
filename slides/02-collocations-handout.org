* Task:  To research collocations and word sketches

For some words of interest to study their collocation properties:
  + Make collocation lists for their immediate left/right contexts and for spans of 2-3 words;
  + Try filtering collocates by their POS tags;
  + Use word sketches from the SketchEngine.

Start with the words in your native language, as it'll make it easier to interpret the words. Try testing this with one word in each language before the Thursday class.

The following interfaces can produce collocation lists:
 + Aranea :: \url{http://aranea.juls.savba.sk}
 + SketchEngine ::  Use the institutional login for Leeds when accessing from home\\
