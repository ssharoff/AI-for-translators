* Outline of exercises
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: outline-of-exercises
  :CLASS: unnumbered
  :END:

On completion of these exercises, you should be able to:

- Navigate in Wikipedia categories to find comparable texts;
- Create a small corpus of comparable texts from Wikipedia;
- Create a bigger corpus by making queries to a search engine;
- Load this corpus into Sketchengine to extract terminology.

* Comparable corpora from Wikipedia
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: comparable-corpora-from-wikipedia
  :END:

1. Find English Wikipedia entries on the topic of International law (use
   =Categories=);

2. Select about 10 entry pairs with iwikis between English and your
   language;

3. Ensure their comparability in terms of sizes and topics for each pair
   of entries;

4. Save the entries in plain text format:\\
   You can experiment with several strategies: (1) Save as text (2)
   copy-paste or (3) use the =Edit/Edit source= option in Wikipedia;

5. Maintain a consistent file-naming strategy and keep a record

* Comparable corpora by manual collection
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: comparable-corpora-by-manual-collection
  :END:

** Manual collection
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: manual-collection
   :END:

1. Select 10-15 keywords for the topic of International Law in English
   and in your language;

2. Find relevant pages, possibly combining two-three keywords in a
   query;

3. Check the top 10 pages returned per query for their relevance. Is it
   acceptable as a sample in your corpus? What are their genres? (use
   the FTD categories discussed in Week 5)

4. Save the relevant pages in plain text (some pages can be in PDF, DOC
   or PPT formats);

5. Maintain a consistent file-naming strategy and keep a record;

6. Create a zip file with your corpus in plain text

** Automated collection via the SketchEngine
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: automated-collection-via-the-sketchengine
   :END:

1. Go to [[http://app.sketchengine.eu/]] and login;

2. Create two corpora by uploading your zipped files for each language;

3. Compile your corpora (wait for the vertical representation to be
   generated);

4. Now you can check the keyword and terms extracted under 'Search
   corpus';

* Topics to discuss
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: topics-to-discuss
  :CLASS: unnumbered
  :END:

- Plain text files and boilerplate.

- Comparable vs parallel corpora.

- Variation in text types.

- Consistency in terminology within and between languages.
